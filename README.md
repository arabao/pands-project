Fisher's Iris data set is a set of data that classes the Iris plant into different categories.
Fisher not only differentiates the Iris plant by its species but also by the sepal and petal width and length in centimetres
This dataset was published by statistician and biologist, Ronald Fisher, in his paper titled 'The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems'. This was then published in the Annals of Eugenics in 1936.

This dataset has been widely analysed and used frequently by beginners for machine learning due to its ease of accessibility and multiple but manageable variables 
The dataset includes 50 samples each of the 3 identified Iris species that were examined and analysed
There are 5 columns in total and 150 rows. 4 of the five columns are numerical values of the length and width of the petal and sepals of the Iris and the fifth column contains the names of the specie type.
